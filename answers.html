<h1>ROUND ONE</h1><hr /><h2>PHP &amp;nbsp; 7</h2><strong>Sammy Kaye Powers’ RFC on CSPRNG introduced:<br>x_bytes(int length)<br>x_int(int min, int max)</strong><br />What is random?<br /><br /><strong>PHP 7 formally deprecates naming constructors after their class, which dates back to this PHP version.</strong><br />What is PHP 4?<br /><br /><strong>Andrea Faulds first authored this RFC, which borrows syntax from HHVM’s Hack language and supports a “strict_types” mode.</strong><br />What are scalar type declarations?<br /><br /><strong>This feature, borrowed from Java and C#, will allow you to do:<br>new class {}</strong><br />What are anonymous classes?<br /><br /><strong>This comparison operator will return 0, -1, and 1 if the left operand is equal to, less than, or greater than the right operand.</strong><br />What is <=>?<br>(the spaceship operator)<br /><br /><h2>Keep It Classy</h2><strong>These iterable classes can only be constructed by calling a function that yields.</strong><br />What is Generator?<br /><br /><strong>Mirror, mirror, on the wall, this extension can access anything: protected, private, and all.</strong><br />What is Reflection?<br /><br /><strong>This class, introduced in PHP 5.5, may be used to ensure that time will never change.</strong><br />What is DateTimeImmutable?<br /><br /><strong>PHP7 introduces this interface, which will be implemented by the Exception and Error base classes.</strong><br />What is Throwable?<br /><br /><strong>SplStack and SplQueue both extend this common base class.</strong><br />What is SplDoublyLinkedList?<br /><br /><h2>Herd of ElePHPants</h2><strong>This European meetup, organized by Rafael Dohms, was the first to produce a black elePHPant.</strong><br />What is Amsterdam PHP?<br /><br /><strong>This PHP conference, which takes place in Las Vegas in the fall, most recently produced elePHPants made from denim.</strong><br />What is ZendCon?<br /><br /><strong>This team, involved with everything from magazine publishing to conferences and training, produced an elePHPant in their signature orange color.</strong><br />What is php[architect]?<br /><br /><strong>This Canadian conference commissioned an order of wooly mammoth elePHPants.</strong><br />What is True North PHP?<br /><br /><strong>This polyglot conference, which is hosted in Montreal, is produces white elePHPants.</strong><br />What is Confoo?<br /><br /><h2>Conference Curiosities</h2><strong>This Ontario landmark built in 1872 forms the picturesque country setting for the inaugural GrumpyConf.</strong><br />What is Elm Hurst Inn and Spa?<br /><br /><strong>This PHP conference in Toronto ran for 5 years and featured a woolly mammoth stuffed toy as a mascot.</strong><br />What is TrueNorthPHP?<br /><br /><strong>Chris Hartjes has eaten this classic desert of German origin almost every birthday of his life.</strong><br />What is Black Forest cake?<br /><br /><strong>This year was the year of the inaugural TrueNorthPHP conference.</strong><br />What is 2012?<br /><br /><strong>This large room served as the location for organised talks at GrumpyConf</strong><br />What is the

/><strong>She helped at registration, and is the long-suffering wife of the Grumpy Programmer</strong><br />Who is the Internet Widow?<br /><br /><strong>This popular framework leader was also involved, at varying degrees, with the creation of five PSRs</strong><br />Who is Matthew Weier O’Phinney?<br /><br /><strong>By organising GrumpyConf, Chris wanted to encourage this nicknamed track that is present at all conferences?</strong><br />What is the Hallway Track?<br /><br /><strong>This Netherlands-based team of developers led by Ramon de la Fuente sponsored this GrumpyConf.</strong><br />Who is Future500?<br /><br /><h1>ROUND TWO</h1><hr /><h2>PHP Sadness</h2><strong>This function is merely shorthand for (!isset($v) || $v != true) and silenced warnings.</strong><br />What is empty()?<br /><br /><strong>PHP arbitrarily disallows throwing exceptions from this magic method, which is useful for casting objects.</strong><br />What is __toString()?<br /><br /><strong>Despite being a common convention to bundle static utility methods in other languages, these classes cannot be final in PHP.</strong><br />What is abstract?<br /><br /><strong>PHP's sort functions all operate in this manner, which make them unsuitable for concise chaining.</strong><br />What is in-place?<br /><br /><strong>This terribly ambiguously named function returns key/value pairs from a URL query string.</strong><br />What is parse_str()?<br /><br /><h2>Continuous Iteration</h2><strong>This interface cannot be implemented directly, but only via Iterator or IteratorAggregate.</strong><br />What is Traversable?<br /><br /><strong>This class allows one or more iterators to be attached in a sequence for seamless traversal.</strong><br />What is MultipleIterator?<br /><br /><strong>This can be thought of as the NOP of SPL iterator classes.</strong><br />What is EmptyIterator?<br /><br /><strong>This class allows code to modify and unset values and keys while iterating over arrays and objects.</strong><br />What is ArrayIterator?<br /><br /><strong>This iterator iterates recursive iterators so you can iterate while you iterate.</strong><br />What is RecursiveIteratorIterator?<br /><br /><h2>Canada, eh?</h2><strong>This language is the second most popular spoken language in Canada?</strong><br />What is French?<br /><br /><strong>This city with a metro population of 1.3 million is also the capital of Canada.</strong><br />What is Ottowa?<br /><br /><strong>This 91 year old British woman of German descent is
